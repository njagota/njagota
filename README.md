- 👋 Hi, I’m @njagota
- 👀 I’m interested in business systems integration and using AI to improve health care delivery and public services
- 💡 I've written code almost every day dor the past 20 years (love it), while maintaining a rich social life with tons of diverse healthy hobbies. It can be done!
- 🍻 I love cold beers and cool motorcycles
- 🌱 I’m currently honing my REACT and MONGO skills in a super fun but long course that I highly recommend
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any fun projects that can improve my SOA/Microservices skills while helping others
- 💩 My repos are all private because my projects are always protected by NDAs. But just ask me for help in any MS tech and I probably have a ton of experience with it!
- 📫 I can be reached at njagota@gmail.com
